    <h1>Welcome to my fashion blog!</h1>

    <h4>What is Fashion?</h4>
    <p>To begin with,la mode is a french word that means fashion.To me, fashion is about what looks good and feels good on a person.Designer names do not mean much if the clothes you see on runways in Paris,Madrid etc etc are the same you'd rather be caught dead wearing.To be honest,I also wouldn't wear those designer clothes.</p>
    <p>I mean,they are either too scanty or too humongous; clothes I would not enjoy wearing.So just to clear the air,I'll only discuss clothes I am very comfortable seeing myself in.</p>

    <h4>Chambray</h4>
    <p>I know most of you are wondering what piece of clothing a chambray is,but worry no more!A chambray is what we Kenyans commonly call a denim shirt.First,when buying a chambray please do not buy one with heavy fabric because it is ususally worn on top of clothes like crop tops,sleevless tops or [for the boys/men]as a shirt.</p>
    <p>I honestly think chambrays are best worn when the weather seems mixed i.e when you are unsure about whether it is going to be sunny or rainy.Also,I wouldn't advise anyone to buy a tight chambray.It is supposed to allow your skin to breathe not suffocate.</p>
    <p>In addition,chambrays are not sold in the blue colour only,for those who feel like blue denim is not their cup of tea.They are also available in black,maroon,green.It just depends on the seller.</p>
    <p>To wrap it up,chambrays do not cost more than 800KES.They are sold at Toy market,Gikomba market and Ngara.</p>
